                Steuart of the Companies,established in 1835 during British
                occupation of Ceylon.<br /><br />
                Having begun operations as a merchant banker and then a produce

              <u><h2>History</h2></u>
              <p>
                The Company traces its history to a British sea captain, Captain
                James Steuart(1790-1870), who sailed the southern seas in the
                early 1800s and settled in 1818 in Ceylon.Captain Steuart,
                seeing the commercial potential of the island, established
                himself as a merchant and a banker.Eventually, Steuart was
                appointed 'Master Attendant of the Roads of Colombo,' a role
                that prevented him from continuing his business activities.As a
                consequence, he welcomed his younger brother George (1808-1896)
                to take over the firm, which resulted in George Steuart and
                Company being founded in 1835.The Sri Lankan government
                initiated a nationalisation policy for privately owned tea
                plantations in 1975, leading to the purchase of 90% of the
                group's assets, the largest tea plantation acreage at the time.
