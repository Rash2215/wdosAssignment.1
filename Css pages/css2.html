                  <h3>Green Tea Mojito</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>New lime juice is added to the sugar (or simple syrup) and mint leaves when cooking a mojito. Through a muddler, the mixture is then gently mashed. 
                    Rum is then applied and the mixture is briefly mixed to remove the sugar and to bring the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation.
                     The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils and should not be shredded.</p>

                  <h3>Tea fried Rice </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Pickled tea leaves are a favorite of mine, and there's nothing in the world like them, I guess. To explain them adequately, I am a little at a loss. They have the flavor of green tea, with the taste of fermentation; they are slightly bitter, slightly salty, and for a few moments they leave a little bit of a tangy aftertaste on the tongue. And they're also getting a good caffeine boost!  </p>

                   <hr>
                   <p>A cup of tea converted into a slice of cake is the Black Tea Cake with Honey Buttercream. By pouring the contents of three tea bags into warmed milk and allowing it to brew before inserting the milk into the cake batter, tea leaves and all the black tea cake is made. To add a special twist, the batter takes on a wonderful hue, with specks of tea leaves.</p>

                <h3> Tea Ice cream </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>There is a strong indication that at the royal dinner party during the Meiji period(1868-1912),
                    Mount Fuji-shaped green tea ice cream was an item on the menu.The true origin of green tea ice cream, however, is unknown. Although green tea itself seems to have existed as local handmade ice cream at some districts in Japan, none of the Japanese flavored ice creams were really merchandised until the 1990s because the major Japanese ice cream manufacturers were producing vanilla, strawberry and chocolate as their primary flavors.</p>
